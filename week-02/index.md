Starting Aug 28.

For Week 2 our goal is to learn how to lay out and style a React Native
application and to add interactions and navigations. By the end of this week you
will be able to build a basic application.

Lab 2 was assigned on Thursday evening and will require building on the
foundations of Lab 1 by handling component state. Lab 2 will be due Saturday by
midnight.
