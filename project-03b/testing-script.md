This is an example of the testing script that I will use to evaluate your
projects. This script is written during software development often by the
product owner. These scripts specify expected functionality and are evaluated
during User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

Please refer to the 
[Project 3 testing script]({{ site.baseurl}}/project-03/testing-script.html)
for details on the user interface expectations.

## API functionality
