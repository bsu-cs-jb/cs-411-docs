- As a father I want to use multiple timers when making dinner so that I
  remember when to stop cooking each part of the meal so that I don't overcook
  dinner.
- As a chef I want to start multiple timers offset from each other so that I can
  be sure that every part of the meal is warm and ready at the same time.
- As a student preparing for med school I want to create multiple timers to
  simulate the allotted time for each section on the MCAT including breaks so
  that I can simulate the actual test-taking experience while taking a practice
  exam.
- As a student if I get interrupted while studying I want to be able to pause my
  timers and have them retain the remaining time so that I can resume studying
  later.
- As a graphic design freelancer I want to create timers for myself to limit the
  amount of time I spend on each part of a client's project so that I complete
  all of my clients' projects by their due dates.
- As a cook I:
    - want the timer to play a sound when finished that I can hear so that I
      remember to take the garlic bread out of the oven.
- As a busy parent I want to be able to create a set of timers for each
  different meal that I prepare.
- As a freelancer I:
    - want to be able to pause, restart and stop a timer so that I can take a
      break when a different client calls me.
- As someone with many roles in my life I want to be able to create several sets
  of timers and use them when cooking, working and studying.


## Out of scope for Project 2

These stories are out of scope for Project 2. They are not required as part of
the rubric.


- As a cook I:
    - want to see the actual clock time when each timer will complete
    - want to assign a label, color and/or icon, image or emoji to each timer so
      that I can easily tell them apart without looking too closely.
    - do not want my device to go to sleep while the timers are running so that
      I can see how much time is left for my meal.
- As a freelancer I:
    - want to delete a timer that I no longer need so that my display is not
      cluttered.
    - want to be able to resume a stopped or reset timer if I accidentally
      pressed the stop/reset button.
