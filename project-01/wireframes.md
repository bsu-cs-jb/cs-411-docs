## Running Timers

This wireframe has not yet been updated. It should include the controls to edit
the name and duration of a timer on the same screen and should not have the back
arrow at the upper left. Customizing the color of the timer is also not required
for part 1. See the 
[requirements in the specification section](specification.html#requirements)
for full details.
