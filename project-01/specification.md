## Scenario

You have been asked to create a simple mobile app as part of your application
process to a software startup. They have seen on your application that you
graduated with a degree in Computer Science and completes CS 411 Mobile
Application Development and have asked you to submit a small application that is
built to follow the specifications in a set of wireframes.

You want to work here... The company has a good reputation... etc.

User stories:

Build a kitchen timer app that allows someone preparing a meal to track each
part separately.


- As someone cooking dinner I want to be able to time the different parts of my
  meal and hear an alert sounds when each timer finishes.
- As someone cooking dinner I want to be able to create several timers with
  different lengths and to start them independently.
- As someone cooking dinner I want to be able to create several timers with
  different lengths and to start them independently.
- As someone cooking dinner when I need to take something out of the oven
  temporarily I want to be able to pause one of my timers and start it again
    later.
- As someone cooking dinner if I have to change my plans I want to be able to
  stop a timer and see how much time was remaining when I stopped it.
- As someone cooking dinner I want to be able to reset a stopped timer to its
  initial value and then start it again.
- As someone cooking dinner I want to be able to give each timer a different
  text label and a color.
- As someone cooking dinner I want to be able to delete a timer that I no longer
  need.
- As someone who cooks the same meal repeatedly I want to be able to create
  different sets of timers and use them in the future.
- As someone cooking dinner I do not want my device to go to sleep while viewing
  the app when timers are running.
- TBD: should the app allow sleep if no timers are running?
## Learning Outcomes

## Process

3. Create a Component for each screen in the wireframe.
4. Add the Components to the React Navigation
   [NavigationContainer](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container).
5. Add components that handle user interaction to change screens in the
   navigation container.
5. Use React Core Components to match the layout in the wireframes for each
   screen.
6. Add state to the components.
7. Add callbacks to handle user interactions for the components.
8. Add styling to the components to match the final design views.
9. Take screenshots of your application and submit them on Canvas along with the
   link to your GitHub repository.
