Definitions of various terms that I use often.

## Punctuation

- `< >` - angle brackets are greater than / less than signs
    - used around HTML and XML elements such as `<div>` or `<View>`
    - used to pass types to generic types and functions such as
      `useState<number>()`
- `( )` - parentheses
    - used to define function parameters
    - used to make function calls
    - used to group expressions
- `{ }` - braces or curly brackets
    - used to embed code inside of text or XML
    - used to enclose a block of statements in code
- `[ ]` - square brackets
    - used to define an array or list

## Objects

This
[JavaScript Objects Cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/game-dev-learn-javascript-objects/modules/game-dev-learn-javascript-objects/cheatsheet)
from Codeacademy is a very good, concise overview of JavaScript objects.

In JavaScript and TypeScript an object has keys and values. In other languages
this is referred to as a dictionary (Python) or Map (Java and others). An object
in JavaScript contains keys which must be strings and the value can be any type.
I loosely use the terms "property," "attribute," "field," and "key" to refer to
the keys of a JavaScript object. In JavaScript these terms do not have
independent meanings. The correct phrasing is that JavaScript objects have
properties that are referenced by using keys.
