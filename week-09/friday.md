- [Lecture repo Friday 10/20](https://github.com/bsu-cs-jb/lecture-10-20-fri)
    - this repo tracks roughly the state of the React Navigation work that I
      showed in class on Friday, plus a little more work on the Edit / Create
      Modal.
- [React Navigation Demo](https://github.com/bsu-cs-jb/demo-navigation)
    - this will be an evolving React Navigation Demo repo
- [Modal Demo](https://github.com/bsu-cs-jb/demo-modal)
    - this repo has a Modal demo based on the previous repo. I will probably
      remove the React Navigation from it to make a more straightforward demo of
      only the Modal component in the future.
