## Notes

I can raise various issues for them to consider with the final project

- monetization
- user tracking
- ad placement
- login experience
- incentivizing behaviors (registration, inviting friends)
- balance between user experience and revenue

They don't have to specifically code up any of these but we can discuss them.
