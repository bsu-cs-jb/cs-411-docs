## Notes

I can raise various issues for them to consider with the final project

- monetization
- user tracking
- ad placement
- login experience
- incentivizing behaviors (registration, inviting friends)
- balance between user experience and revenue

They don't have to specifically code up any of these but we can discuss them.

### Monetization

Indecisive makes money in several ways related to the collection of user
behavior and preferences.

- Aggregate user behavior is tracked and sold to various companies as marketing
  data. Examples:
    - number of people interested in a new movie
    - restaurant preferences and popularity
    - interest in media properties: movies, video games, concerts, shows and
      performances, etc.
- Direct sale advertisements
    - The owners of Indecisive prefer direct ad sales to improve the user
      experience rather than subscribing to an ad service.
    - Indecisive only shows highly relevant, high-quality ads that do not
      interrupt the user experience and these ads have a very high conversion
      rate.

### First use

Users can use the app without logging in or creating an account. On first use,
the app will assign them a user token which will keep track of their history on
the backend and can be used to register in the future, keeping their history.


### Incentivizing Registration
