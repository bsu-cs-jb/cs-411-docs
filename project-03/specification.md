## Due Date: The Future

## Context

Have you ever been in those situations where you are trying to make a decision
with a group of friends about where to go, what to eat, who goes first, or what
game to play next? This app solves all of your indecisiveness. Instead of
learning social awareness and negotiation skills, this app will make the
decision for you so you can relax and enjoy yourself. After all, if the decision
turns out to be wrong, it was the app's fault!

## Goal

Design and create an app that helps groups of friends make decisions. The
decision may be immediate, "Who shoots first in a game of HORSE?" or for a time
in the future "What movie should we watch on Saturday?" The people making the
decision may be in the same room ("Who spins the bottle first?") or across the
globe, ("Which village should we raid next?). The people making the decision may
have used the app previously or may be using it for the first time. Users can
save their preferences if they register and see a history of previous decisions.
First-time users join the decision with an invitation code.
